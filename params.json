It also contains information about accessing the web GUI. \r\n\r\nThere are *three ways that you can review the simulations* associated with the paper. The first two assume you have R installed. R is a free software program and you can aquire the basic version at one of these mirrors:\r\n\r\nhttp://cran.stat.ucla.edu\r\n\r\nhttp://cran.case.edu\r\n\r\nhttp://cran.wustl.edu\r\n\r\n## 1. Download the source code.\r\n\r\nOn the page https://github.com/robiRagan/kMajorityRule in the bottom corner you will see a button called \"Download Zip\" this will allow you to download the source code for the R Package. \r\n\r\nOnce you have downloaded and unzipped the file you will find an R file called evaluateViaSource.R. This is a heavily commented file that will allow you to run the commands line by line necessary to replicate the figures in the paper.\r\n\r\n## 2. Install the R Package (Recomended)\r\nThis is the simplest way to review the code and replicate the figures in the paper. Because this R Package is not an offical package reviewed by the offical R organization (CRAN) you need to install a package to R before you can install this package.\r\n\r\n* Install R and run it.\r\n* At the console prompt \">\" type: install.packages(\"devtools\")\r\n* Now load devtools by typing at the console prompt \">\": library(devtools)\r\n* Now you can install the kMajorityCost package with: install_github(\"robiRagan/kMajorityRule\")\r\n* Load the package with: library(kMajorityRule)\r\n* Then open the main help file with: ?kMajorityRule\r\n\r\nThe main help file contains links to all the functions and their help files as well as instructions on how to run demos that replicate all the figures in the paper. \r\n\r\n\r\n## 3. View the Web Based GUI\r\n\r\nA web based interface for running the simulations from the paper (and others). It can be quite slow, compared to running the simulations with the R Package on your own computer.\r\n\r\nhttps://robiraganshinyapps.shinyapps.io/kMajorityGUI/",
